## About




This project is an educational exploration of different voting systems. While not an expert in the field, I find this topic fascinating 
and so I wanted to create a platform that will present in a clear, visual and engaging way. Most of the material so far comes from carefully untangling Wikipedia articles (which are often fraught with contradictions and errors!) and from the excellent Ace Project
The mechanics of voting systems have large influence in shaping the political power. The project will always be opensource and non-monetized, and I invite everyone who finds this interesting to join me.
