 * Data for parallel voting (also called superposition or mixed system).

 * Parallel voting employs two or more distinct electoral systems side by
 * side to elect different members of a legislature. Typically, a portion of
 * seats is filled using a winner-take-all system such as first past the
 * post, while the remaining seats are allocated using proportional
 * representation. The results of each part are calculated independently and
 * then combined.

  In a parallel voting system, two separate electoral methods operate at the
  same time. Voters typically have two votes: one for a local candidate and
  one for a party list. Some seats are awarded to district winners using a
  majoritarian or plurality method, while the rest are apportioned
  proportionally based on party votes. Because the systems run in parallel
  and do not interact, the proportional seats do not compensate for
  distortions in the majoritarian component.
